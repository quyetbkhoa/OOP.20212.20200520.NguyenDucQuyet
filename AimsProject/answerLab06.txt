   Create an ArrayList of Media, then add some media (CD, DVD, or Book) to the
list.
- Iterate through the list and print out the information of the media by using
the toString() method.
Observe what happens and explain it in detail.
Answer:
Since it is the arrayList of Media, all element (which maybe is Cd, dvd or book) would be upcasting to Media object.
we have definition of Upcasting: Upcasting gives us the flexibility to access the parent class members but it is not
possible to access all the child class members using this feature. Instead of all the members, we can access some 
specified members of the child class. For instance, we can access the overridden methods.
Since the toString method have been overriden in cd, dvd, and book class, the code will print the toString method in each children
class, not parent class( which is Media).
