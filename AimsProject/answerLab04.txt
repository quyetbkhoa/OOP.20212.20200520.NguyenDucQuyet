1. After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD), why does the title of these two objects still remain?
   The value of jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD is the references to their corresponding object.
Since Java is pass-by-value, when we pass jungleDVD and cinderella to swap(), the
function swap() creates two copies of value of jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD, we
will name tham fake1 and fake2 and implement function on them.
.Anything you do on fake1 and fake2 will not affect jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD. Therefore, two objects remain unchange 
2. After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()), why is
the title of the JungleDVD changed?
 In this method, when we pass the "dvd" to the function changeTitle. This function will work on 
a copy version "dvd1" of "dvd", which have the same value as "dvd" ( the value mentioned here is the reference to 
the object DigitialVideoDisc). Therefore, when we write dvd.setTitle(title) ( or dvd1.setTitle()) since we work on a copy), 
it still point to the same object that "dvd" point to to implement the method setter and change the its title eventually.
